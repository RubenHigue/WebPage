                                I started my scholar studies at Jaén, in the Attendis schools group, where I spend my first
                                six years of education path, at this place I started to develop myself as a student,
                                it was a bilingual school, so I had to study half of my matters, as Natural Science or Maths
                                in English, which is not my native language. Due to this fact, I started getting my Cambridge
                                Certificates at the age of 6 when I got my Movers Certificate. I am grateful that my first
                                educational years were here because it made me realize that the school level must not be only
                                measured by the knowledge you get from it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When I got to college, I moved from the Attendis school to Maristas Jaén school and stayed here
                                for the next six years of my life. Here I kept on with my educational path but not only as
                                a student but as a person. At Maristas school they gave us what it is called as the Maristas's
                                ethos, where were not only taught on how to pass exams and acquire knowledge but also on
                                how to respect everyone, how to be grateful for everything that happens to us, and how to treat
                                people right and have good manners, alongside with much more other ways to behave in different
                                situations and with different people. At the same time, they gave us a perfect classic education
                                as it has been shown year after year by all the students who had gone through the school. Here I
                                decided that my academic path to follow was going to be the computer science one as so many teachers
                                cheer me up to make it happen. So I will always be thankful for my years here as they not only
                                gave me the courage to face my future career, but also they build me as the person I am right now
                                and gave me the guidelines to follow for my personal development.

                                In 2020, I started my degree in Computer Science at the University of Jaén. It was an awkward situation
                                as we entered this new chapter of life with the COVID-19 crisis, so it was very strange not to see
                                many people in class or even don't know your classmates because of this illness, so it was such a situation
                                to deal with. But as this first year passed through and the COVID situation too, I started feeling great as
                                I met a lot of new friends and mates that made my life much easier than this first year. From this first
                                year until this fifth year I have developed myself, making things I thought I was not capable of, and
                                getting out from situations I never imagine I could get out from being successful. As long as the years
                                had been passing by, I am more and more interested in my field of studies, and I am really looking forward
                                to get to my master studies and even my PhD.
